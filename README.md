Cyber Threat Detection Using Machine Learning
This repository contains the code and resources developed for my MSc Computer Science dissertation titled "Cyber Threat Detection Using Machine Learning" at the University of Sussex.

📖 Overview
The project explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques for detecting botnet activities in network traffic, using the CTU-13 dataset. It focuses on implementing and comparing various ML algorithms—such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and hybrid models—to improve accuracy and effectiveness in cybersecurity threat detection.

🎯 Objectives
Detect and classify botnet traffic using ML models.

Compare the performance of individual ML models and hybrid approaches.

Evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Propose improvements using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and ensemble modeling.
